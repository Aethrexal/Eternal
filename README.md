# Eternal

This whole README is currently being worked on.

## Introduction

I made this pack in hopes to keep me playing with the same world for years to come, so the pack includes mods that hopefully will be updated eventually to where I can update the pack to 'newer' versions of Minecraft as well; but also mods that I like to use when I play modded minecraft.

Not really much else to it, made so it also can be played with a server with friends.

The current state of the pack might be a bit laggy and have double of same ore and what not, but it is being worked on.

## Instructions

### Install

1. Download [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/) or [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download)
2. Click "Add Instance"
3. On the left side press "Import from zip"
4. Then either copy this url and paste it `https://github.com/Rinnray/Eternal/releases/download/1.0.2/Eternal.zip` or [download](https://github.com/Rinnray/Eternal/releases) the zip file and import it that way.
5. Click "OK"
6. Done, unless you wanna change RAM then keep reading

### Changing RAM

Incase you want to increase the amount of RAM the modpack is able to use, this is how you do that:

1. Select the modpack
2. Click "Edit Instance" on the right side
3. Select "Settings"
4. In the "Java" tab go to "Maximum memory allocation" the default should be "6144MiB". Change that to your desired number. If you want to give Minecraft 9GB you take 1024 \* 9 and you'll get 9216. Just enter that number into the field.
5. Click "Close"
6. Done

### Updating Forge

At times it might be needed for you to manually update the Forge version when the modpack have updated, this is how you do that:

1. Select the modpack
2. Click "Edit Instance" on the right side
3. Select "Version"
4. Select "Forge" in the list
5. Click "Change version" on the right side
6. Select "40.2.0"
7. Click "OK" then "Close"
8. Done

None of the mods are hosted in this repo, the packwiz-installer that comes with the zip file that you download, downloads all the mods from Curseforge or Modrinth when you launch the modpack.
But anyway; I do not take credit for any of the mods in this modpack.

Note:<br/>
The above does not include these mods (as they were exlucded from Curseforge API and needed to be downloaded manually):

- [Minecraft Transit Railway](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecraft-transit-railway)

[Packwiz](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz) was used to generate these files.
