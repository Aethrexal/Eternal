### Changed

- Tempad
  - Reduced the amount of power it uses, for both normal and advanced.
  - Increased the amount of power it stores, for both normal and advanced.

### Notes

- With Death Backups, hopefully all your items *should* be safe even if the gravestone mod messes up!
- If you haven't already noticed with other mods, sometimes some items have the same crafting recipe. In a normal crafting table you're able to press a button and choose another item, but that button does not appear everywhere. Tom's Simple Storage and QIO From Mekanism is one example.
- We now have 3 different ways of storage, Tom's simple storage I'm thinking is a nice early game (Except infitive wireless as it requires a beacon in different levels), Refined storage for a nice mid, then QIO from Mekanism is a more awesome end type of deal.

### Notes

- You *might* have to update version of NeoForged yourself if it doesn't launch. To do that use [this](https://github.com/Rinnray/Eternal?tab=readme-ov-file#updating-neoforge) guide.

- Ballistix might mess some Shaders up, if you do play with shaders and you notice anything weird then you're either gonna have to change or play without.

- Previous version had 208 with all optionals enabled (Except bobby if you had farsight enabled and vice versa) and 200 mods without. This version have 175 mods with all optionals and 166 without.

- Presence Footsteps file is currently hosted in the GitHub Repo as I had to change the Forge version it requires to make it work.
- Since we starting to use Xaero's Map instead, your waypoints for FTB Chunks map won't be transfered over. The FTB Chunks map can still be accessed, you just need to open the inventory and click the map on the top left corner, that's where you can find your waypoints as well.
This won't last forever though as FTB Chunks will be removed in a future update.

### Notes

I'm replacing Forge with NeoForge to give that a try how well the compatibility is between the mods.
It *should* be a 1:1, but we'll see.

The biggest reason for the change is because pretty much all Developers from Forge have moved over to NeoForge due to the owner being very toxic. You can read more [ħere](https://neoforged.net/news/theproject/) if you're really curious.

There's no auto update to move you to it, so there's a few things you need to do.
1. Select the modpack and click `Edit`
2. Go to `Verion`
3. Select `Forge` and press `Remove` on the right.
4. Click `Install Loader`
5. In the list that appears, select `NeoForge` then `47.1.81`
6. Click `OK` and you're done!

Alternatively you can remove the intance you have and completely re-install it all.

### IMPORTANT

The game *will* crash. But to fix that you're gonna have to do this (This is only if you're updating with your current pack. This wont be needed if you import the zip like first install):
1. Select the modpack and press `Edit` on the right side.
2. Go to the `Version` tab.
3. Select `LWJGL 3` and click `Change Version` on the right.
4. Select `3.3.2` (should be on the top) then OK and you're done.
